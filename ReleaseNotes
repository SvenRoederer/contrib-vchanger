 Release Notes for vchanger 0.8.5

 Release 0.8.5

 Minor bug fix release. Fixes link errors for older versions of e2fsprogs on some
 distros (bug 2941290). Also applies the "safe strncat" patch to prevent a buffer
 overrun present in strncat in some standard C libraries.

 Release 0.8.4

 This release is a bug fix release. All users of version 0.8.3 should upgrade to
 0.8.4 to prevent a bug causing Bacula to mark volumes in error.
 
 Change Summary:
  The slot number passed in parameter 3 is now ignored for the LOADED command.
  This should fix a bug causing Bacula to mark a volume loaded into a drive in
  error when a job starts after the magazine has been removed. 

 Bugs Fixed:
  2907225  Slot number should be ignored for LOADED command
  2872006  Compile fail on FreeBSD 7.2

 Release 0.8.3

 This release adds the ability to specify magazine partitions by UUID,
 making it much easier to use multiple simultaneous magazines.
 
 Change Summary:
  Specifying magazine partitions by UUID is a paradigm shift in the way magazines
  may be assigned to a particular autochanger. Previously, magazines were assigned
  to an autochanger by giving the magazine a filesystem label matching the
  autochanger's name. Standard udev rules on many distributions create a device
  symlink in /dev/disk/by-label that allow easily configuring autofs to mount the
  magazine at a known mountpoint. This works well for a single magazine autochanger,
  but for a multi-magazine autochanger special udev rules are needed to create
  unique device symlinks when all of the magazines have the same filesystem label.
  Since the standard udev rules on most systems create device symlinks by filesystem
  UUID under /dev/disk/by-uuid, assigning magazines to an autochanger by UUID makes
  it much easier to configure automounting that will work for an autochanger with
  any number of simultaneously mounted magazines.
  
  Note that magazines may still be specified as a directory path, so the previous
  methods still work, however it is recommended to assign magazines by UUID if
  possible.
  
  As an aid to working with multi-magazine autochangers, a new extended API
  command, LISTMAGS, was added to list the magazines currently "inserted" into
  each of the autochanger's magazine bays. Like the INITMAG command, it is an
  extension to the Bacula Autochanger API and so is never invoked by Bacula.

 Bugs Fixed:
  2785183  Unable to detect when drives inserted using the vchanger
  2872006  Compile fail on FreeBSD 7.2
